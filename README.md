# SportSearch
Real time pickup app finder

# Description
App to find, create, and join local pickup sports in your area(area being 5 mile radius closest to you). Everything is updated in real time and once you join a particular game, you can instant message with the other people that have joined that game.

# HOW TO RUN
Import the code into android studio. The one potential hiccup you could run into when deploying on a board is the first time you run the app, it will ask you to allow it location permissions. If you say no, the app is essentially useless since it is a location based app, if you say yes, then you're good but you need to click the map button at the bottom to essentially refresh the page. If the are any other things you notice, please email bwproud@live.unc.edu
